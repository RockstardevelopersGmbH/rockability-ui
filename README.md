# Rockability-UI

The Rockabilit-UI is an accessible component library running for Svelte and SvelteKit projects. It provides several UI elements that are highly customizable and accessible out of the box. If the components are used so that they become inaccessible, errors will be printed in the console of your browser, so you immeadiatly know what to do to make them accessible again.
